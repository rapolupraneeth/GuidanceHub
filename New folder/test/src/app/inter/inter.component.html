<td>MPC</td>

<td> One of the most popular and commonly pursued streams in senior secondary school is the Non-Medical stream. Also referred to as MPC subjects, this stream lets you dive into the non-medical side of the domain of Science. The MPC full form in intermediate studies is Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, thus, it puts thrust on these three main areas. With a diverse curriculum, MPC subjects offer a wide range of career opportunities to explore. Architecture, Engineering, Defence Services, Commercial pilot, Statistics, Industrial Designing and Data Analytics are some of the few professions you can strive for.</td>
<td>
<b>MATHS:</b> Mathematics as a subject not only hones our problem solving and analytical skills but also enhances our reasoning ability. While Physics and Chemistry introduce us to the laws of the world, Math helps in establishing the relationship between them. <br>
<b>PHYSICS:</b>Physics is one of the oldest and most diverse fields of Science It is a fundamental discipline that deals with the study of matter, energy, nature and their interdependence
<br>An important part of MPC Subjects, physics works on the principle of reductionism and can broadly be categorized into 2, Modern and Classical Physics. While Classical Physics focuses on the macroscopic (thermodynamics, acoustics, electromagnetism. mechanics etc.) aspects, Modern deals with the microscopic elements (atoms, nanotechnology, relativity, quantum physics etc)<br>
 <b>CHEMISTRY:</b>The following are the five core branches of this subject: <br>

Organic Chemistry. The study of Carbon, Hydrogen and Carbon-Hydrogen

compounds is called Organic Chemistry. Some common examples include alkanes, alcohols

and DNA. These compounds are widely used in the pharmaceutical, plastic, paints,

cosmetics, and coating industries. <br>

Inorganic Chemistry la simple terms, it is the study of everything not organic, ie compounds without C-H bonds Metals, salts and minerals form perfect examples <br>

Analytical Chemustry: Ever wondered how the blood samples of a patient are analyzed? Or how milk adulterants are found? This is where analytical chemistry comes inte the picture. It is the science of identifying and analyzing compounds both quantitatively and qualitatively. <br>

Physical Chemistry: The science of studying physical properties of elements and compounds like their boiling points, colour, temperature etc. is called Physical Chemistry

Biochemistry: It is that branch of chemistry which deals with the study of chemical processes that take place inside living organisms. <br>And some courses are meant to be common for all</td>

<td>A MPC student can pursue Defence Services through NDA which requires Mathematics in Class 12, so you have an advantage of choosing Physics, Chemistry and Maths subjects. <br>

Besides becoming an Engineering aspirant, you can wish to choose Biotechnology field. or go for higher degree in Mathematics and Statistics<br>

If you are fond of chemical reactions, you will love to have higher degree in some field of Chemistry and research and publish your own Chemistry papers. <br>

You can also go for B. Sc programe in particular field as per your interest, It all depends on your Career goal & interest </td>

    <td>BIPC</td>
    <td>BiPC, popularly known as the Medical stream is a subject combination which is opted by students studying in senior secondary school. The full form of BiPC is Biology, Physics, and Chemistry. Be it the traditional medical courses like MBBS and BDS or alternate medical courses, the diverse curriculum of this stream offers a plethora of career opportunities to explore after standard 12th.</td>
    <td><b>BIOLOGY:</b>Coined by Lamarck, Biology is simply the study of all types of living organisms. As a natural science field. It focuses on the vital life processes, organisation and occurrence of living creatures. <br>There are many branches of biology, the most famous are, Zoology, Botany, and Microbiology. While Zoology is the study of the animal kingdom, Botany deals with the study of plant life. Microbiology, on the other hand, is thescience of microorganisms <br><b>PHYSICS: </b>Another natural science branch, Physics is the study of the observable components of the Liniverse. An important part of BiPC subjects, it broadly deals with the study of energy, matter and how they depend on each other <br> Biophysics, a newly emerging field is now becoming popular among students. It is an interdisciplinary branch which helps in solving Biology problems using Physics concepts. Sound knowledge of physics and biology will help you in pursuing this course</td>
    <td>You are not necessarily required to appear for NEET after taking HiPC since there are several courses other than MBBS in these subjects that you can explore. <br>You can also pursue short-term courses after BiPC like D Pharmacy, Homeopathy courses, Paramedical courses, etc. <br>Not only the medical field, but you can also explore lucrative careers in research, academia, medical journalism, etc by taking BiPC in intermediate </td>

    <td>CEC</td>
    <td>CEC stands for Civics Economic Commerce. However, the CEC course covers a lot more than just civics and economics. The syllabus also includes business studies, which makes it quite different from other courses in the field of social sciences, such as BA or BCom (Hons).<br>CEC students can also choose mainstream courses like BA, B.Com, B.Ed after Graduation to start their own or family Business, Corporate/ Private Jobs, lecturer, Professor, Probationary Officers in different Nationalised Banks, Government Jobs, UPSC-IAS, IPS, IFC, IRS, TSPSC by appearing for Group I and Group II Examinations,<br> Indian Railways, Indian Police Department, Indian Army, Indian Navy or Indian Airforce, etc.</td>
    <td><b>CIVICS:</b> Civics is defined as the study or science of the privileges and obligations of citizens <br>Civic education is the study of the theoretical, political and practical aspects of citizenship, as well as its rights and duties. It includes the study of civil law and civil code, and the study of government with attention to the role of citizens-as opposed to external factors in the operation and oversight of government.<br><b>ECONOMICS:</b>Economics is a social science with stakes in many other fields, including political science, geography, mathematics, sociology, psychology. engineering, law, medicine and business <br> The central quest of economics is to determine the most logical and effective use of resources to meet private and social goals. Production and employment, investment and savings, health, money and the banking system, government policies on taxation and spending, international trade, industrial organization and regulation, urbanization, environmental issues and legal matters (such as the design and enforcement of property rights), are just a sampling of the concerns at the heart of the science of economics<br><b>COMMERCE:</b>Commerce is defined as the exchange of goods and services among individuals and business entities. In academics, Commence is considered to be one of the most popular streams of education along with Science and Arts. Commerce deals with the various aspects of husmess, trade, accounting, financial information/transactions and merchandising <br> Commerce plays a significant role in the development of nations and its citizens by facilitating trade between nations or within the nation.</td>
    <td>Soon after the completion of CEC courses in intermediate, scholar can join several 3 year Bachelor degree courses such as B.COM. B.A.. BBM, and BBA<br>After the completion of any of the above courses, scholar can choose for MIRA course which is in good demand nowadays,<br> MBA applicants are being sold as hot cakes in the market as each and all business is to require of good managers in order that handle several actions of the organization</td>

    <td>HEC</td>
    <td>HEC is a 2 year intermediate course where the students opting for this will have History, Economics and Civics as their primary subjects of study. Along with this English is a compulsory subject and a language is included where the students can choose among languages such as Telugu, Sanskrit etc. <br>To be eligible for this course, the candidate must have passed the 10th standard examination (or equivalent) from a recognized board.</td>
    <td><b>HISTORY:</b>L-History is the study of the past. This study would also include learning about humanities and social sciences.
